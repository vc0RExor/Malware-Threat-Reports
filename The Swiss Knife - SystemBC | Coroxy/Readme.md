_SystemBC, also known as Coroxy or DroxiDat, is a malware categorized as Proxy malware, a Bot, a backdoor, and even a RAT, as its uses can be diverse depending on the attacker, making it a versatile tool for Threat Actors. Active since 2018, it has gained significant popularity, finding a warm reception in underground markets where it can be purchased, and its interest has not waned. Incidents involving its usage are recorded annually._

_Coroxy achieves execution on target systems through various methods, depending on the group using it. Recorded attacks have involved reconnaissance phases, lateral movement, and the deployment of SystemBC, often complemented with CobaltStrike. In other cases, it has been employed in campaigns through Spear-Phishing, where it is delivered and installed on the victim's system via loaders or other malware. While the malware's methodology has evolved, its core functionality remains consistent. In most versions of SystemBC, it seeks to gather system and user information, establish persistence, and then create a Socks5 connection with the Command and Control (C&C) server, transmitting basic information, and waiting for commands or the launch of other malware by the attacker. This provides a backdoor for the attacker to operate from their infrastructure._

As mentioned earlier, numerous groups have been associated with the use of SystemBC over the years. These groups, with many linked to ransomware activities, include:

* ViceSociety
